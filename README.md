# popSR
We have provided a loss function for the task of single-image super-resolution. An implementation embedding the penalizer in the [SRCNN](https://github.com/tegg89/SRCNN-Tensorflow) is available here. Other necessary instructions for CNN-independent employment of the loss function will be subsequently provided.
